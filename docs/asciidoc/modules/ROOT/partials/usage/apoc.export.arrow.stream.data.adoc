Let's suppose we have this data set:

[source,cypher]
----
"CREATE (f:User {name:'Adam',age:42,male:true,kids:['Sam','Anna','Grace'], born:localdatetime('2015185T19:32:24'), place:point({latitude: 13.1, longitude: 33.46789})})-[:KNOWS {since: 1993, bffSince: duration('P5M1.5D')}]->(b:User {name:'Jim',age:42}),(c:User {age:12}),(d:Another {foo: 'bar'})"
----

With this query:

[source,cypher]
----
MATCH (n:User)
MATCH ()-[rels:KNOWS]->()
WITH collect(n) as node, collect(rels) as rels
CALL apoc.export.arrow.stream.data(node, rels, null)
YIELD value RETURN value
----

we receive a byte[] with a set of Apache Arrow's `FieldVector` with this names:
- `_id`: for node id
- `_labels`: for node labels, joined with `:`
- `_start`: for start node id (in case of relationship)
- `_end`: for end node id (in case of relationship)
- `_type`: for relationship type
- To distinguish the properties of nodes and relations,
a prefix "nodeProp___" will be placed to the node props and a "edgeProp___" to the edge props.
So for example, the property `name` will be stored in a FieldVector with name `nodeProp___name`
