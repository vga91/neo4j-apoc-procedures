Let's suppose we have this data set:

[source,cypher]
----
CREATE (f:User {name:'Adam',age:42,male:true,kids:['Sam','Anna','Grace'], born:localdatetime('2015185T19:32:24'), place:point({latitude: 13.1, longitude: 33.46789})})-[:KNOWS {since: 1993, bffSince: duration('P5M1.5D')}]->(b:User {name:'Jim',age:42}),(c:User {name: 'John', age:12}),(d:Another {foo: 'bar'})
----

With this query:

[source,cypher]
----
CALL apoc.export.arrow.stream.query('MATCH (n:User) RETURN count(n) as count, n.name as name')
YIELD value RETURN value
----

we receive a byte[] with a set of Apache Arrow's `FieldVector` with this names:
- `_id`: for node id
- `_labels`: for node labels, joined with `:`
- `_start`: for start node id (in case of relationship)
- `_end`: for end node id (in case of relationship)
- `_type`: for relationship type
- To distinguish the properties of nodes and relations,
a prefix "nodeProp___" will be placed to the node props and a "edgeProp___" to the edge props.
So for example, the property `name` will be stored in a FieldVector with name `nodeProp___name`
- Other `FieldVector`s based on result

So in this case, we have 2 vectors: `name` with values 'Adam', 'Jim' and 'John' and `count` with values '3', '3' and '3'
