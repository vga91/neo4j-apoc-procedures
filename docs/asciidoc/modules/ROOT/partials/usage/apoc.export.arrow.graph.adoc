Let's suppose we have this data set:

[source,cypher]
----
CREATE (f:User {name:'Adam',age:42,male:true,kids:['Sam','Anna','Grace'], born:localdatetime('2015185T19:32:24'), place:point({latitude: 13.1, longitude: 33.46789})})-[:KNOWS {since: 1993, bffSince: duration('P5M1.5D')}]->(b:User {name:'Jim',age:42}),(c:User {age:12}),(d:Another {foo: 'bar'})
----

With this query:

[source,cypher]
----
CALL apoc.graph.fromDB('neo4j',{}) yield graph
CALL apoc.export.arrow.graph(graph, "graph.arrow",{quotes: 'none'})
YIELD nodes, relationships, properties, file, source,format, time
RETURN *
----

we have this result:
.Results
[opts="header"]
|===
| file         | source                        | format | nodes | relationships | properties | time
| "graph.arrow" | "statement: nodes(4), rels(1)" | "arrow" | 4     | 1             | 12          | 123
|===


And will be created 2 files `edges_graph.arrow` and `nodes_graph.arrow` containing respectively relationships and nodes,
with a set of Apache Arrow's `FieldVector` with this names for nodes' file:
- `_id`: for node id
- `_labels`: for node labels, joined with `:`
- properties with name as FieldVector name

and for edges' file:

- `_start`: for start node id (in case of relationship)
- `_end`: for end node id (in case of relationship)
- `_type`: for relationship type
- properties with name as FieldVector name
